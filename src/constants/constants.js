      `A full-stack web app that I built with MERN stack, but with a twist. I added my own ASP.Net backend server to see if ` + 
      `I can make API calls to more than one server using React + Redux. What's great about this? ðŸ˜„ Well, it works! I was able ` +
      `to successfully use React and Redux together to make api calls to two different servers. So I'm pretty proud of this one.`,

      `related videos, along with searched videos. It's currently unable to store comments, but that will be a feature implemented ` +
      `in future iterations. I worked on this project with a buddy of mine while a student at DevCodeCamp. His name is James Burgess. `,

      `Construction Ecommerce web application that you saw earlier. It was a pretty sweet project that took minimal effort to implement ` +
      `but it also taught me how powerful apis can be. Once properly implemented within one's own app, this can serve as a means of communication ` +
      `between clients and owners.`,

      `when I finished this project. It was definitely a great experience to work with Carter in a paired programming style.`,
